This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

We will ask players to type 1 to answer yes or type any other number to answer no in order to accomplish our quiz game. We will not ask them to type action commends. Rather, it would be a simple command you type in numbers.
